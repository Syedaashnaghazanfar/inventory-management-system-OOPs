# 🧠 Inventory Management System

A **fully object-oriented** Python-based Inventory Management System designed for real-world usage. This project demonstrates strong understanding and implementation of **OOP concepts**, **custom exception handling**, and **test-driven development (TDD)** using `pytest`.

## 🚀 What This Project Covers

> Built with care. Tested with precision. Styled with love. 🐍❤️

### ✅ Core Features
- Add, remove, search, and restock products
- Track **product categories**: Electronics, Grocery, and Clothing
- Automatically handle **product expiry and out-of-stock conditions**
- Calculate **total inventory value**
- Prevent duplicate product IDs via custom exceptions
- Separation of concerns using **Python classes, inheritance, and encapsulation**

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Custom Exceptions**
- **`pytest`** – for unit testing
- **Folder-structured project layout** (ideal for scaling)
- **PEP8-compliant** coding style

---

## 🧪 Testing with `pytest`

All major functions were tested using unit tests inside the `tests/` folder. The goal? Zero red lines, total control.

### 🔍 Test Cases Implemented:
- Duplicate Product ID detection
- Selling & restocking logic
- Expiry-based product removal
- Search by name & type
- Inventory value calculations
- Exception handling on invalid actions

✅ **All 10 tests passed**

## 📚 What I Learned

This project was more than just writing code — it was about building **robust systems**. Here's what I took away:

- 📦 **Real-world class structuring**
- 🔁 **Inheritance and polymorphism** across product types
- 🧱 **Custom exception handling** using Python’s `Exception` subclasses
- 🧪 **Test-Driven Development** (writing code with tests in mind)
- 🗃️ Clean **project organization** (module imports, environment setup)
- ⚙️ Using `pytest` like a pro!
